I was recently hired by a fantastic company called The NetCircle. I'll be doing development there on one of the web applications and am extremely satisfied already.

The company develops community driven websites and has some really fantastic developers working there, who are really active in the development community. I'll be working a lot with the Symfony framework, which is great news for me as I've been wanting to delve more deeply into it and really get some experience working with it.

The only downside is the move to Shanghai. I know, I know, what a terrible thing to have to move to Shanghai, with all the fun and excitement. But I really miss the peace and quiet of Suzhou (and the far more affordable housing).

I'm going to throw some neat links here about the new company:
