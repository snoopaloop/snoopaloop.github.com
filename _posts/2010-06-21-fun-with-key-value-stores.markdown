For the last couple of days, I have been looking at key-value data stores for implementing a message system. The two I'm working with now are MongoDB and Riak. As I gain some more experience using them, I will add some new posts describing some of the main features of the two and my reactions working with them.

For now, I'd like to share a cartoon that is linked on the Riak blog:
