<p>Well, not exactly. I'm tired of Wordpress's antics on my current VPS host, so since this blog doesn't get updated much and really does not have any dynamic content I'm moving it to Github Pages and using Jekyll to generate the pages.</p> <p>What you see here is literally the work of untold... minutes. It's really quite simple, and of course I will need to spend some more time figuring it all out, but so far so good!</p>
