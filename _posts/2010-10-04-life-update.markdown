It's been quite a while since I've actually written anything on my blog here, and especially nothing personal. Well, I guess I will throw out some updates. I'm still working hard on creating an indexing solution for Riak at work, where the index is in a Riak bucket.

While some initial testing is promising, there are some kinks to work out, and I still have a long way to go producing efficient Erlang code. I'm really loving the experience and hope to have something nice soon with good benchmarks for our workload. Working with a functional programming language and especially with Erlang has really been an eye-opening experience, but is not without it's difficulties.

On the personal side, about a month ago I got engaged to my girlfriend of 2 years (finally, I'm sure she thought). It's been quite interesting to wake up every day and think to myself "you are getting married". Yikes. Luckily, she's of the same mindset as me, the one where we defer and wedding planning until as late as possible. Since I'm American and she's Chinese, we will actually go this month or next month to do the wedding certificate stuff, because it's such a beast to do the immigration papers for the US. Just writing that, all I can think is "yikes".
